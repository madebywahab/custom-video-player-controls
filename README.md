# 🎬 Interactive Video Player with Play/Pause Overlay & Control Buttons | JavaScript  
(customize your video player with a clickable overlay button for smooth play/pause functionality using pure JavaScript. Features custom SVG icons, event listener optimization, and a seamless user experience. Perfect for media websites and custom players!
) 

## ⚠️ Note  
I have **disabled pointer events** for `.progress`, meaning users **cannot skip** to another part of the video but can **only rewind**. If you prefer to allow seeking, simply remove `pointer-events: none;` from the `.progress` class in the CSS.
